I am a computer science major and I am expected to graduate in 2029.

## My Favorite Labs

### Lab 4
  I enjoyed both the game part of this lab and the work of it. I learned how to store an input of one player and compare that to the input of another. A lab like this will help me when I get to the point of comparing multiple, complex values quickly and accurately.

### Lab 6 Part 2
  I particually enjoyed this lab because I already enjoy playing jackblack. 

### Lab 10
  I found the use of getting the information of a county's population to be interesting. The conversion of a 2D vector to a string to be then converted into the necessary numerical value will be greatly important in the line of work I want to be in. The use of vectors and strings will be important to creating the games Iâ€™ve always wanted to make.
